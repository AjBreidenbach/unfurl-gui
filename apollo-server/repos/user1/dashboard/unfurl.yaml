        #   you should declare sensitive properties like this following in secrets/secrets.yaml or local/unfurl.yaml or define them as environment variables:
        #   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID:
        #   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY:
        #  For more properties see https://unfurl.run/docs/tosca.html

        # Alternatively, if you have already declared the connection in UNFURL_HOME you can rename the existing connection by
        # setting "primary_provider" to the name of the inherited connection, for example:
        # primary_provider: aws
